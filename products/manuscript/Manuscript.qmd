# Summary/Abstract

The primary goal of this research project is to develop a predictive model to estimate medical insurance costs for individuals based on their health-related and personal attributes. This model will help in understanding the key factors influencing insurance charges and assist insurance companies in pricing policies more accurately.

# Introduction

## General Background Information

### Importance of Predictive Modeling in Insurance

Predictive modeling plays a vital role in the insurance industry. Accurate predictions of insurance costs enable companies to:

-   Assess risk more effectively.

-   Set premiums that reflect the actual risk associated with individual policyholders.

-   Enhance customer satisfaction by offering personalized and fair pricing.

On the consumer side, individuals can benefit from understanding the factors that influence their insurance costs, allowing them to make informed choices about their health and financial planning.

## Description of data and data source

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. The dataset comprises 2.7K rows and 7 columns and contains the following features:

-   **Age**: Age of the individual.

-   **Sex**: Gender of the individual (male/female).

-   **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight.

-   **Children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.

-   **Smoker**: Smoking status of the individual (yes/no).

-   **Region**: Geographical region in the US where the individual resides (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).

-   **Charges**: Medical insurance costs billed by the insurance company (target variable).

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

The primary question we aim to answer using the "Medical Insurance Cost Prediction" dataset is:

**"What are the key factors influencing medical insurance costs, and how accurately can we predict these costs based on individuals' demographic and health-related attributes?"**

### Outcomes of Interest

The main outcome of interest in this analysis is:

-   **Medical Insurance Costs (charges)**: The amount billed by the insurance company for an individual's medical insurance.

### Specific Predictors

The specific predictors (independent variables) we will focus on include:

-   **Age**: How age influences insurance costs.

-   **Sex**: The impact of gender on insurance costs.

-   **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: The relationship between BMI and insurance costs.

-   **Children**: How the number of dependents affects insurance costs.

-   **Smoker**: The effect of smoking status on insurance costs.

-   **Region**: Regional differences in insurance costs within the US.

### Relations/Patterns of Interest

I am looking for several key relationships and patterns in the data, including:

1.  **Age and Insurance Costs**:Investigating whether older individuals tend to have higher medical insurance costs.

2.  **Gender Differences**:Analyzing whether there is a significant difference in insurance costs between males and females.

3.  **BMI and Insurance Costs**:Exploring the relationship between an individual's BMI and their medical insurance costs.Identifying any nonlinear patterns where very high or very low BMI values might correlate with higher insurance costs.

4.  **Impact of Smoking**:Assessing how smoking status (yes/no) affects insurance costs.Quantifying the cost difference between smokers and non-smokers.

5.  **Number of Children**: Examining whether having more dependents (children) increases insurance costs.

6.  **Regional Variations**: Identifying differences in insurance costs across different regions in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
